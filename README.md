BotChat: AI-Powered Chat for Android


Work in Progress: An Android app for seamless AI conversations powered by cloud APIs, local servers, and offline LLMs.



BotChat is an open-source Android application that enables users to engage in natural conversations with AI models. Whether you prefer cloud-based APIs (OpenRouter, HuggingFace), a local server, or running lightweight LLMs directly on your device, BotChat offers flexibility and control over your AI experience. Select from a variety of language models and enjoy offline capabilities for privacy and convenience.



Note: This project is under active development. Features may evolve, and contributions are welcome!
